Different types of selectors are:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
The advantages of selectors are:
Simple syntax since they include a single element in their structure.
Performance is the same or faster compared to XPath.
Easier to learn than XPath, easier to use.
CSS Selector only allows unidirectional flow.
