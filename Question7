Grid and Flexbox are layout systems in CSS that allow you to create flexible and responsive web layouts. While they both offer layout capabilities, they have different approaches and use cases.
Grid is best for two-dimensional layouts with many elements that need to be precisely positioned relative to each other. Flexbox is better for one-dimensional or single-line layouts where you just need to space a bunch of elements a certain way.
